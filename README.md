# FizzBuzz Flask App
*This is an implementation of the FizzBuzz problem in Flask*

By default the app shows the first 20 numbers with FizzBuzz filter.

If you navigate to the app's url and add `/fizzbuzz/100` at the end the app will show the first 100 numbers, and if you change the number at the end to yet another number it will show the numbers in that range maximum.
